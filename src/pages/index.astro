    <p>Hi! <br> I'm Semii! </p>

    <p>
        This website is an outlet for my Creativity. Still setting up. 
        <a href="https://semii.space/">checkout my portfolio</a>
    </p>

    <p>Some fun facts about me:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I enjoy staying active</li>
        <li>I find yard work satisfying</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

        ðŸš§This site was built with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>. I learned a lot while setting it up,
        but I realized that Astro is overkill for what I originally wanted. 
        I need fewer moving parts, so I've decided to rebuild it with
        <a href="https://github.com/xiokka/ironite/tree/main"> ironite</a>.
        Ironite doesnâ€™t have everything I need, but since Iâ€™m in the process
        of learning Rust, this will be a great chance for me to contribute  to
        opensource.ðŸš§
